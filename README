# MPI-CPP

  mpi-cpp is a header-only C++ API for MPI (The Message Passing interface)

# DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

mpi-cpp has been designed as a lightweight header-only C++ interface to MPI. It aims to offer a
minimalist alternative to Boost.MPI and solve some of its design issues.

mpi-cpp aims to :
- be header only. No need to recompile boost or anything to support multiples MPI backends ( openmpi, mpich2, mvapich2, intel mpi )
- follows a "no-compromise" C++ philosophy.
- Support for MPI_Datatype instead of implicit Boost.Serialization
- Transparent STL container mapping
- Transparent STL std::string mapping
- C++11 move/future support


# PLATFORMS and compiler support
- Tested on IBM BlueGene/Q ( XLC++ )
- Linux x86_64 ( GCC )
